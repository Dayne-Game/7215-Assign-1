# Content Management Systems (CMS)

A content management system is a piece of software that helps and allows users to create, manage, and change content on their website. The users can do this without any specialized technical knowledge. The content management system acts like the infrastructure to your website, so you don’t need to worry about creating web pages, storing images etc. and can focus on the front-end of the website.

## Types of Content Management Systems

There are five different types of content management systems. Component Content Management System (CCMS), Document Management System (DMS), Enterprise Content Management System (ECM), Web Content Management System (WCMS), and Digital Asset Management System (DAM).

### Component Content Management System (CCMS)

Component Content Management Systems allows you to manage content at a component level. This type of system tracks links, versions and metadata that is associated with each component. Using Component Content Management System (CCMS) allows you to do these five amazing things:

- Manage Content as Individual Paragraphs and words instead of pages and documents.
- Maintain single sourced versioning
- Reuse Content (like resusing Components), so you don't need to rewrite or copy and paste
- Translate once
- Multi-Channel Publish to any output or system.

### Document Management System (DMS)

Document Management Systems with use of software stores, manages, and track electronic documents and electronic images that are paper based information that have been scanned through a document scanner. There are five key features that come when using a Document Management System:

- Check-in/check-out and locking, to coordinate the simultaneous editing of a document so one person’s changes don’t overwrite another’s
- Version control, so tabs can be kept on how the current document came to be, and how it differs from the versions that came before
- Roll-back, to “activate” a prior version in case of an error or premature release
- Audit trail, to permit the reconstruction of who did what to a document during the course of its life in the system
- Annotation and Stamps

### Enterprise Content Management System (ECM)

ECM is a systematic collection and organizes information for a specific audience. These specific audience are Business Executives, Customers etc. ECM isn't a singlke technology, process, or methodology. ECM works by dynamically combining strategies, methods and tools together that are used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver information supporting key organizational processes through its entire lifecycle.

Here are five points when using Enterprise Content Management System (ECM):

- Capture boils down to entering content into the system.
- Manage is what you do next to it, so it can be found and used by whomever it is intended for.
- Storing it means finding it an appropriate home in your infrastructure, be it a formal content management system or other information solution.
- Preserve refers to long-term care – archiving, if you will – the practice of protecting it so it can be utilized however far into the future the organization needs it to be available.
- And deliver is all about putting the information in the right people’s hands right when they need it to be there.

### Web Content Management System (WCMS)

Web Content Management Systems helps maintain, control, change and reassemble content on a webpage. WCMS is used to create, manage, store and display content on webpages. WCMS (like all other CMS) manages the intergrity, revisions, and lifecycle of the information. There are three key features of a Web Content Management System:

- The ability to design and organize websites to provide efficient and effective access to relevant and up-to-date content
- The ability to control and prepare the content for publication, including orchestrating and controlling content evaluation and approval before publication on the website
- The automation of key parts of the publishing process

### Digital Asset Management System (DAM)

DAM is used to store, share and organize digital assets in a central location. DAM also encourages the benefits when creating files such as images, videos and other multimedia. DAM is pretty much the solution to any organizations content storage and sharing. DAM helps get rid of the abundance of digital content, by storing it centrally for all departments and outside clients to have quick access too. There are eight benefits when using DAM:

- Organizes digital assets in a central location
- Automates workflows and enhances team creativity
- Locates media files quickly using sophisticated search capabilities
- Manages press kits and picture collections
- Automates watermarking for images
- Manages permissions through extensive copyright functionality
- Saves space with a seamless cloud experience
- Tags images automatically and uses facial recognition
