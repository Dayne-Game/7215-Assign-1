# Client-Server Computing

## Client-Server and Uses of Client Server

According to <i>webopedia.com</i>, Client-Server Computing is a computing model that involves client computers and a server. The process begins when the client computer communicates and makes a request to the server over a network. The server shares its resources, applications and or data with the client computer, and can even share to multiple client computers at the same time on the network. A client computer is a device that is connected to the network (phone, tablet laptop, Desktop PC etc.).

## Why has Client-Server Computing Evolved

With technology evolving each year, Client Server Computing has evolved massivley from the start till now. When Client Server Computing first started out, the server did all of the grunt work, and than sent out the HTML to the clients computers, and thats what they see. Now with the evolution of Client Server Computing, the server only holds the data, and each client computer does all of the fetching and requesting straight from the browser, so instead of the server getting multiple requests, it only gets one request. This makes the servers work alot easy, making the maintenance, cost and up keep, alot cheaper and easier.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Fat Client-Server Architectures

**Advantages**

_Rich Graphic User Interface_

Fat Client-Server Architectures have the capability of delivering rich graphical user interfaces. These interfaces include operating systems, immersive computer programs, and heavy graphic video games.

_Server Performance Efficency_

Fat Client-Server Architectures doesn't need high performing/powerful servers. Fat Client-Server performs tasks at a local or individual level not at a centralized level. This overall means low cost when purchasing, installing and maintaing of servers.

**Disadvantages**

_Maintenance_

Every computer will need to be maintained, tehy must be updated for bug fixes and security updates for each software program. The hardware must be maintained at levels acceptable for the software applications they will be using.

_Data Backing Up_

If data is stored on a local machine, it will need to be consistanly backend up to the server in order to protect organisations data.

### Thin Client-Server Architectures

**Advantages**

_Optimization of Hardware Resources_

Thin Client-Server Architectures require less/fewer hardware requirements. This means that Thin Client-Server Architectures need less cabling, bussing and switching, which makes Thin Client-Server Architectures cost-effective.

_Reduced Hardware and Software Maintenance_

Thin Client-Server Architectures offer easier hardware and software administration, troubleshooting, system or application patching, security updates, and data migration.

**Disadvantages**

_Single Point of Failure_

Since Thin Client-Server Architecture performs tasks at a centralized level, this cane bring a huge potential risk. Since Thin Clients are connected to one server, if that server goes down/crashes all the clients connected will be affected.

_Subject to Network Loss_

Thin Client-Server Architecture gets responses from ther server. So if there is a network connection loss, users of a thin client wont be able to connect to the server so therefore wont be able to do any work.
