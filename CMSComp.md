# CMS Comparison

In this CMS Comparison I will be comparing Wordpress and October CMS.

## Wordpress

Wordpress was built using PHP and MYSQL. Wordpress was born out of the desire to be able to build website applications without any programming or design knowledge. The roots of Wordpress got back to the golden era of 2001. Wordpress is the successor (and offical sucessor) of b2/cafelog. Wordpress powers 34% of the web, so there are a lot of features that Wordpress provides. Wordpress strives on simplicity and flexibility. Nothing should get in the way when creating a Wordpress website. The flexibility of Wordpress allows you to create any type of website you want, wether its for a blog, your business or your own personal website. The Wordpress publishing wizards make it so much easier to create content for your website through the built in wizards. These wizards make sure everything fits and works even before you publish your website, so you know that the website will be ready to us right off the bat! Wordpress has a lot of different prices for different types of websites. You can make your website for free but with reduce personalization, and tools.

## October CMS

October CMS is a free, open source CMS that is based on the Laravel PHP Framework. October CMS won the Peoples choice award in the Best Flat File CMS awards in 2018. October CMS was created by Alexey Bobkov from Canada and Samuel Georges from Australia. Collectivly they have more than 30 years experiance in Web Development. Alexey and Samuel both had an interest in PHP (back when it ws called Personal Home Page), and together with all their experiance in PHP decided to create **October CMS**. The philosophy of October CMS was to make "Web Development Fun Again!", they state the web development is easy, and everyone knows a bit of HTML, so they thought why not use that alongside PHP to make a flat file CMS.

October CMS is built using laravel which is the best PHP framework to date, Laravel its self has all the tools necessary for building quality websites and applications. October CMS also has easy adminstrative interfaces, which make sthe proccess of creating tables and so on easier. There is also Page Components that are the builidng blocks of the website, that cane be easily created, and update for more functionality and so on.
